### Project Title
Sakila Company Business Improvement Analysis

### Description
The project was targeted at analyzing DVD rental data for Sakila, a DVD rental company using SQL. The data was for the year 2007, and the analysis was focused on using the data to answer specific questions as a window into improving Sakila's bottom line while keeping the customers happy. The areas investigated are as follows:

1. Customer rewards program: Reward the highest spending customers as an incentive to rent more DVDs.
2. Purchasing of the most demanded movies: Spend more money on buying the most frequently rented movie types.
3. Develop a targeted ad campaign: Spend more Ad money in the cities with the highest rental sales.
4. Further fine tune types of movies purchased: Investigate possible factors affecting movie rental cost.
